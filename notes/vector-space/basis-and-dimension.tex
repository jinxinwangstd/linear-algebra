\section{Overview}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Basis and dimension
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Def: A basis and its basis vectors of a vector space
    \item Examples of a basis and its basis vectors of a vector space
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Eg: The standard basis of the coordinate space
    \end{itemize}
    \item Thm: The uniqueness of the linear representation (the coordinate) of every vector in a space with a basis
    \item Thm: The existence of a (linear) isomorphism between a space of $n$ dimension and $K^n$
    \item Def: A (linear) homomorphism between two vector spaces, injective homomorphism and surjective homomorphism
    \item Examples of (linear) homomorphisms between two vector spaces
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Eg: $\phi: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{N}}$
      \item Eg: $\phi: \mathbb{R}^{\mathbb{N}} \to \mathbb{R}^n$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Def: A (linear) isomorphism between two vector spaces
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Rmk: Two vector spaces can form an isomorphism only if they are on the same field.
      \item Rmk: An isomorphic map between two vector spaces maps the zero vector in one space to the one in the other, and it maps a basis of one space to a basis of the other.
      \item Rmk: If $\phi: V \to U$, $\psi: U \to W$ are both isomorphic maps, then $\phi^{-1}: U \to V$ and $\phi \psi: V \to W$ are both isomorphic maps.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Examples of (linear) isomorphism between two vector spaces
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Eg: $\mathbb{C} \simeq \mathbb{R}^2$
      \item Eg: 实斐波那契数列空间 $\simeq \mathbb{R}^2$
      \item Eg: $M_n(K) \simeq K^{n^2}$
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  \item Properties of a basis of a vector space
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Prop: The uniqueness of the number of vectors in every basis of a vector space
    \item Def: The dimension of a vector space
    \item Prop: A necessary and sufficient condition of two vector spaces on the same field to be isomorphic
    \item Thm: The linear independence of $n+1$ vectors of a space of dimension $n$ $(n < \infty)$
    \item Thm: Two necessary and sufficent conditions of a set of vectors to be a basis of a space of dimension $n$ $(n < \infty)$
    \item Thm: The possibility of a set of linear independent vectors to become a basis of a space of dimension $n$ $(n < \infty)$
    \item Def: Finite-dimensional spaces and infinite-dimensional spaces
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Examples of finite-dimensional spaces
      \item Examples of infinite-dimensional spaces
    \end{itemize}
    \item Def: A maximal linearly independent subset of a finite-dimensional space
    \item Thm: Existence, the uniqueness of the number of vectors, and the linear span of maximal linearly independent subsets of a finite-dimensional space
    \item Def: The rank of a subset of a vector space 
  \end{itemize}
  \item Transition matrix (Change-of-basis matrix)
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Def: A transition matrix from a basis to another
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Rmk: The uniqueness of the transition matrix from a basis to another
    \end{itemize}
    \item Rmk: Transform the coordinate of a vector under a basis of its space to the coordinate under another basis with the transition matrix between the two basis
    \item Thm: The inversibility of the transition matrix between two basis of a vector space and its meaning
    \item Thm: The composition of two transition matrices between three basis of a vector space and its meaning
  \end{itemize}
  \item The order of the vectors in a basis
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Rmk: By default, a basis of a vector space is an ordered set of vectors, and its order is fixed
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
