\section{The sum of two subspaces of a vector space}

\begin{definition}[The sum of two (or finite) subspaces of a vector space]
  Let $V$ be a vector space, and $U$ and $W$ be two subspaces of $V$, then the sum of $U$ and $W$, denoted by $U + W$, is a set as follows:
  \begin{equation}
    U + W = \left\{ u + w \mid u \in U, w \in W \right\} 
  \end{equation}
  Similarly, the sum of finite subspaces $U_1, U_2, \ldots, U_n$ is defined as
  \begin{equation}
    U_1 + U_2 + \cdots + U_n = \left\{ u_1 + u_2 + \cdots + u_n \mid u_i \in U_i, i = 1,2,\ldots,n \right\}
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}

\section{The direct sum of two subspaces of a vector space}

\begin{definition}[The linear independence and dependence of finite subspaces]
  A finite class of subspaces $U_1, U_2, \ldots, U_n$ are linear independent if the equation $u_1 + u_2 + \cdots + u_n = 0$ where $u_i \in U_i, i = 1,2,\ldots,n$ iff. $u_1 = u_2 = \cdots = u_n = 0$
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[A necessary and sufficient condition for a class of subspaces to be linear independent in terms of basis]
  Let $V$ be a vector space and $U_1, U_2, \ldots, U_n$ be subspaces of $V$. $U_1, U_2, \ldots, U_n$ are linear independent if and only if the union of the basis of all subspaces are linear independent.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[A necessary and sufficient condition for a class of subspaces to be linear independent in terms of the decomposition of vectors in the sum of these subspaces]
  Let $V$ be a vector space and $U_1, U_2, \ldots, U_n$ be subspaces of $V$. $U_1, U_2, \ldots, U_n$ are linear independent if and only if there exists a unique way to express a vector in $U_1 + U_2 + \cdots + U_n$ as $u_1 + u_2 + \cdots + u_n = 0$ where $u_i \in U_i, i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$.
\end{theorem}
